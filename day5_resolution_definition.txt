resolution ===> no of pixels to be displayed in that screen of monitor 


eg 1920 by 1080 p ===> 1920 pixels in width and 1080 pixels in height ===> total 1920 * 1080 pixels in whole screen

size and area of 1 pixel depend upon quality of screen 




higher resolution === > good quality ==> not always 


higher resolution in small screen ===> best result 



agar screen bahut badi hui let say 50inch and resolution kam toh pixels ka size increase ho jayega to cover whole screen ==> blury 


wahi phone choti screen hai toh 480*360 pixrls bhi enough hote hain , unke size chote hi rehte hain and good quality 


overall 

resolution ==> total number of pixels to be displayed on screen 



let say screen is of 10000 mm by 10000 mm 

resolution = 400 by 400 pixel 


size or area of 1 pixel ====   10000 * 10000   /  400 * 400 



smaller the area of 1 pixel ===> better the quality ===> lesser the blurness 




======>> quality totally depend upon resolution as well as size of screen
